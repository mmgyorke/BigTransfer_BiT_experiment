## Image Classification using BigTransfer (BiT)

In this repo, I will be experiementing with Image Classification using BigTransfer (BiT). I am starting off with the keras implementation, and using the tf_flowers dataset. The first implementation utilizes the BiT-M R50x1 model, available on TensorFlow Hub. 

As I experiment further, I will be referring to the original paper, "*Big Transfer (BiT): General Visual Representation Learning*," by A. Kolesnikov, L. Beyer, X. Zhai, J. Puigcerver, J. Yung, S. Gelly, and N. Houlsby.
