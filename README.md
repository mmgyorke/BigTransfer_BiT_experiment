## Image Classification using BigTransfer (BiT)

This is the keras implementation of (BiT) - Big Transfer on the tf_flowers dataset. The first implementation uses the BiT-M R50x1 model, from TensorFlow Hub. 

As I experiment further, I will be referring to the original paper, "Big Transfer (BiT): General Visual Representation Learning," by A. Kolesnikov, L. Beyer, X. Zhai, J. Puigcerver, J. Yung, S. Gelly, and N. Houlsby.
